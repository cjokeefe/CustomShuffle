This program lets a user select one of their own public Spotify playlists to be "reshuffled" according to certain parameters. The purpose of this is to replace Spotify's built-in shuffle feature, which I am personally not satisfied with.

As of right now, the available shuffle techniques are:
- Pure random
- Uniform distribution of artists (songs by the same artist will be roughly evenly dispersed through the track list)

This program will not run without the Client ID and Client Secret until it's deployed to the web.

To-do:
Make the frontend pretty
More shuffling techniques
Deploy to web
